"""Workspace-repo seed-loop.

Walks ``examples/workspace-seeds/`` and POSTs each file to the Gitea
Contents API under the ``nexus_seeds/<path>`` prefix in the user's
workspace repo. Two callers (non-mirror mode → admin-owned repo,
mirror+user mode → user's fork) hit one CLI invocation parameterised
by ``--repo <owner>/<name>``.

Server-side curl loop (consistent with :mod:`infisical` +
:mod:`secret_sync`): the rendered bash runs over rsync'd JSON
payloads, so the Gitea token transits via a remote ``--config``
tmpfile (NOT argv) and never reaches ``ps`` / CI logs / exception
messages.

Eight rounds of hardening preserved (one regression test per round in
``tests/unit/test_seeder.py``):

R1. ``set -euo pipefail`` first executable line in the rendered bash.
R2. Token via ``curl --config <tmpfile>`` (NOT argv) — same defence
    as infisical.py and Module 1.2 secret_sync.
R3. EXIT trap cleans push-dir + curl-config tmpfile, with ``[ -n ]``
    guards on optional vars.
R4. HTTP-code dispatch (200/201 → created, 422 → skipped, else →
    failed), exec'd-bash regression test (Modul-2.0 lessons).
R5. ``Path.resolve()`` rejects ``..``-escape from ``root``.
R6. Symlinks skipped (regular files only).
R7. File ordering deterministic (operators rely on it for log debug).
R8. Token never in stdout / stderr / exception messages.
