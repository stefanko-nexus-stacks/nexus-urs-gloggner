"""Pipeline-side orchestration for S3 spinup-restore + teardown-
snapshot (RFC 0001 PR-2 + PR-4).

This module is the *caller* of the pure-rendering functions in
:mod:`nexus_deploy.s3_persistence`. The split mirrors the
``setup.py`` pattern: ``s3_persistence.py`` produces bash strings,
``s3_restore.py`` reads environment / config, builds the target
lists, and ships the rendered scripts to the remote via
:class:`SSHClient`. Two directions live here:

* **spinup-restore** (:func:`restore_from_s3`) — pulls the latest
  snapshot from R2 onto the server's local SSD right after
  bootstrap, before docker compose comes up.
* **teardown-snapshot** (:func:`snapshot_to_s3`) — pushes the
  current state to R2 right before ``tofu destroy``, with the
  atomic verify-before-destroy contract from RFC 0001 §"Atomicity
  guarantees".

The module name predates the snapshot side; it's kept for stable
imports (4 call sites today). Both directions share env-var
parsing, feature-flag gating, and the canonical target list.

Public surface:

* :class:`S3RestoreSkipped` / :class:`S3RestoreApplied` — outcome
  marker classes returned by :func:`restore_from_s3`. Tests assert
  on the type; pipeline.py branches on ``isinstance()`` and reads
  ``reason`` (Skipped) or ``snapshot_timestamp`` (Applied) for
  the one-line stderr summary.
* :func:`build_endpoint_from_env` — read the five required env
  vars (three ``PERSISTENCE_S3_*`` — endpoint, region, bucket —
  plus the project-wide ``R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID`` and
  ``R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY``), return a populated
  :class:`S3Endpoint`. Returns ``None`` when any of them is
  unset — the caller treats that as "S3 persistence not
  configured on this stack, skip the phase."
* :func:`standard_targets` — produces the canonical tuple of
  postgres + rsync targets for the two stacks we persist
  (Gitea + Dify). Hard-coded for v1.0 because those are the only
  stacks with persistent data on the volume; a future
  per-stack config registry can replace this if other stacks
  start carrying state.
* :func:`restore_from_s3` — the orchestration entry point.
  Render rclone config + restore script via
  :mod:`s3_persistence`, ship them through ``ssh.run_script``,
  return a typed result.

Feature flag: this whole module is a *no-op* if
``NEXUS_S3_PERSISTENCE`` is not set to ``true`` in the spinup
environment. That keeps the existing volume-mount path
unchanged for stacks that haven't migrated yet (RFC Phase A:
prepare without breaking changes). The flip happens per-stack
during Phase B/C of the rollout — see RFC 0001 phased-rollout
plan.

Why a flag rather than presence-of-env-vars detection: a stack
mid-migration may have the PERSISTENCE_S3_* env vars populated
*before* its volume data has been evacuated to S3. Silently
flipping to the S3 path on env-presence would cause the first
post-flag spinup to come up with empty data dirs and the
existing volume detached + ignored. The explicit
``NEXUS_S3_PERSISTENCE=true`` flag forces an operator-aware
flip per stack.

       + Postgres) and Dify (storage + Postgres + Weaviate + plugins).
    2. The mappings are user-name / database-name pairs from the
       respective ``docker-compose.yml`` files. Hardcoding here is
       defended by the unit tests, which assert those mappings stay
       in sync with the compose files; a docs-comment near the
       fixture would drift, the test won't.
    3. A future per-stack registry (services.yaml extension, or a
       dedicated config table) can replace this single function
       without touching any caller — :func:`restore_from_s3` only
       sees the returned tuples.

    Mappings (verified against ``stacks/gitea/docker-compose.yml``

    PR-2 time):

# Compose-file list for the stop-before-snapshot step. v1.0 stops the
# two stateful stacks (Gitea, Dify) before pg_dump so we get a
# quiesced view. Other stacks aren't stopped — they don't carry
# state, and the longer we keep them up the shorter the spinup-side
# downtime window. If a future stack gains state, extend this list AND
# add to standard_targets().
#
# Paths match the on-server layout the orchestrator already uses
# elsewhere (compose_runner.py writes each stack to
# /opt/docker-server/stacks/<name>/docker-compose.yml).

    Teardown-side counterpart to :func:`restore_from_s3`. Returns
    a typed outcome:

    * :class:`S3SnapshotSkipped` (``"feature_flag_off"``) — the
      stack hasn't opted in. Caller proceeds with the legacy
      teardown path (no snapshot, volume keeps the data on
      Hetzner across teardowns).
    * :class:`S3SnapshotSkipped` (``"no_endpoint_env"``) — flag on
      but credentials missing. **Caller MUST abort the teardown**
      here — the operator opted in to S3 persistence but the
      env is misconfigured; proceeding with ``tofu destroy``
      would mean the next spinup pulls an empty bucket and the
      volume data is the only copy of student state. CLI handler
      maps this to a non-zero exit code.
    * :class:`S3SnapshotApplied` — snapshot written, verified
      (every per-source ``rclone check`` passed), and
      ``snapshots/latest.txt`` updated. Safe to proceed with
      ``tofu destroy``.

    Any non-zero exit from the rendered bash propagates as
    ``CalledProcessError``. That's the atomicity gate: rclone
    drift, pg_dump failure, or compose-stop failure all map to a
    hard abort. The teardown workflow must let it bubble up
    (``set -e`` in the workflow shell step) so ``tofu destroy``
    never runs against an unverified snapshot state.

    ``stack_slug`` + ``template_version`` are caller-supplied so
    the rendered manifest carries the right identity. Production
    callers read them from tofu outputs / env vars; tests inject
    string fixtures. ``timestamp_factory`` is the DI seam — tests
    pass a lambda returning a deterministic value; production
    uses :func:`_build_snapshot_timestamp`.
