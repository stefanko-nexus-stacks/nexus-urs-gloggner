"""Kestra flow-registration client.

Registers the two ``system.git-sync`` / ``system.flow-sync`` flows
that drive the workspace-repo onboarding loop, and optionally
triggers a one-shot ``flow-sync`` execution so user-seeded flows
appear immediately instead of waiting for the 15-min cron.

The architecture uses ``ssh.SSHClient.port_forward`` to open a tunnel
and talk to Kestra's REST API via local ``requests`` calls, surfacing
HTTP errors as typed Python exceptions. No server-side rendered bash,
no heredoc-quoting, and the entire flow logic is unit-testable
against ``responses``-mocked HTTP without ever running ssh.

API:

- :class:`KestraClient` — basic-auth REST client. ``wait_ready``,
  ``register_flow`` (POST 200/201 / 422 → PUT 200/201 / failed),
  ``execute_flow``, ``wait_for_execution``.
- :func:`render_system_flow_yaml` — string-template YAML builder for
  the two system flows.
- :func:`run_register_system_flows` — top-level orchestrator: takes
  an already-forwarded ``base_url``, instantiates KestraClient,
  waits for Kestra, registers both flows, optionally triggers
  ``flow-sync`` and verifies that the canonical seeded flow appears.
  Caller (the CLI in ``__main__._kestra_register_system_flows``) is
  responsible for opening the SSH port-forward — keeping the tunnel
  outside this function lets ``responses``-mock the HTTP layer in
  tests without an ssh roundtrip.

Auth note (R4): basic-auth credentials are passed to ``requests`` via
the ``auth=(user, pass)`` keyword, which puts them in the
``Authorization`` header — never in argv on either host (we don't
shell out at all here, except to ssh for the tunnel which carries
no service-side credentials in argv).

#    task with ``delete: true`` would reconcile Kestra's
#    ``nexus-tutorials`` namespace to whatever's in the Gitea
#    fork. A student editing a flow in the Kestra UI had a
#    15-min window before their changes vanished — invisible
#    data loss with no error log.
#
# 2. **Ping-pong with flow-export below.** Push-direction
#    (Kestra → Gitea, ``system.flow-export``) and pull-direction
#    running on similar cadences caused commit churn: every push
#    triggered a pull which re-pushed identical content.
#
# Steady-state source of truth: Kestra UI for student edits,
# Gitea for upstream/seeded flows. ``flow-export`` (push) keeps
# Gitea in sync with UI; ``flow-sync`` (pull) re-hydrates Kestra

# Push direction: Kestra UI → Gitea fork. Runs every 10 minutes
# so a stack crash loses at most ~10 minutes of student work.
#
# **Scope: ``my-flows.*`` only.** Two namespaces with two
# different meanings under Option C of the bi-directional sync
# design:
#   - ``nexus-tutorials.*``  — seeded reference material. Lives
#     at ``nexus_seeds/kestra/flows/`` in Git. Read-mostly from
#     the student's perspective. NEVER pushed back from Kestra
#     UI (would corrupt the upstream-distributed examples).
#   - ``my-flows.*``         — the student's own work. Lives at
#     ``kestra/flows/`` in Git (no ``nexus_seeds/`` prefix
#     because it's NOT Nexus-Stack-shipped content). Pushed
#     here by this flow every 10 min.
#
# Recommended student workflow: clone-then-edit. Open the seeded
# tutorial flow, save-as with a fresh id under the ``my-flows``
# namespace. The clone gets auto-exported here; the original
# stays untouched in Git as reference material.
#
# Echo-prevention: ``sourceNamespace: my-flows`` excludes both
# ``system.*`` (infrastructure flows including this exporter)
# AND ``nexus-tutorials.*`` (seeded reference material). The
# PushFlows plugin has no exclude-list, so positive-only
# scoping is the ONLY way to prevent the exporter from
# pushing itself or corrupting upstream seeds.
#
# ``delete: false`` because a UI delete shouldn't auto-rewrite
# Git history. To permanently delete a my-flows.* flow,
# the operator commits the deletion directly in the Gitea fork.
#
# Synthetic commit identity (``Kestra Auto-Export`` /
# ``kestra@nexus-stack.local``) so commits aren't attributed to
# a real user. The Gitea push log still shows the admin token
# holder as the pusher — acceptable trade-off.
#
# Conflict behaviour: PushFlows fails loud on
# ``REJECTED_NONFASTFORWARD`` (no force-push, no rebase). A
# parallel direct-to-Gitea commit from the operator would
# cause this — visible in the Kestra execution log, manually
# resolvable.
