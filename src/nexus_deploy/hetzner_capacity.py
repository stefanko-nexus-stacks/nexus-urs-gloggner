"""Hetzner Cloud capacity-aware server selection (Issue #536).

The legacy deploy used a single (server_type, server_location) pair
and failed at ``tofu apply`` time when Hetzner had no stock for that
exact combination — common during the 2025/26 capacity crunches.
This module queries the Hetzner Cloud API BEFORE tofu runs and picks
the first available pair from an operator-provided preference list,
falling through to the next entry when the preferred one is sold
out.

Public surface:

* :class:`ServerSpec` — frozen ``(server_type, location)`` pair.
* :class:`HetznerCapacityError` — API/auth/network/schema failure.
* :func:`parse_preferences` — comma-list parser with validation.
* :func:`fetch_availability` — calls ``/v1/server_types`` +
  ``/v1/datacenters`` and returns ``location -> {available type names}``.
* :func:`select` — walk preferences in order, return first match.

Default preference list lives in :data:`DEFAULT_PREFERENCES` — used
when neither config.tfvars nor the workflow override provides one.

Why two API calls instead of one: ``/v1/datacenters`` returns
server-type IDs as integers; the per-stock list is keyed by ID, not
name. We resolve names→IDs via ``/v1/server_types`` once, then walk
the datacenters response. Both endpoints are stable and the round-
trip is small (a few KB each).

# Default preference list — picked in Issue #536, expanded 2026-05
# (post-May-stock-crunch tiers), revised mid-2026-05 by the operator
# of the Education fork after a class-wide spin-up failed against
# the prior list (cx43 / cpx41 / cx42 / cx52). Strategy unchanged:
# shared-only (no dedicated, no ARM), five type-tiers in cost order,
# three EU regions per tier.
#
#   Tier 1: cx43 (Intel shared, 8 vCPU / 16 GB / 160 GB, project
#           default since 2026-05). The cheapest box that still fits
#           the 40+ Docker stacks workload.
#   Tier 2: cx53 (Intel shared, 16 vCPU / 32 GB / 320 GB). One step
#           up if cx43 is dry across all three EU regions — keeps
#           Intel + shared, just gives more headroom.
#   Tier 3: cpx42 (AMD shared, 8 vCPU / 16 GB / 240 GB). Same
#           8/16 class as cx43, different silicon → independent
#           stock pool. linux/amd64 images run on Intel and AMD
#           without distinction (per CLAUDE.md).
#   Tier 4: cpx52 (AMD shared, 16 vCPU / 32 GB / 360 GB). AMD
#           equivalent of cx53.
#   Tier 5: cpx62 (AMD shared, 32 vCPU / 64 GB / 720 GB). Last
#           resort when nothing else has stock — generously oversized
#           but keeps the spin-up unblocked.
#
# Region order hel1 → fsn1 → nbg1 within every tier — matches the
# historical project default ``server_location = "hel1"`` from
# ``tofu/stack/variables.tf``, so a fresh install that doesn't
# configure SERVER_PREFERENCES at all lands in the same region as
# before #537. Falkenstein and Nuremberg follow as failovers. (PR
# #537 R2 #2 — reordered so the built-in default doesn't silently
# change the region for new installs.)
#
# Deliberately excluded:
#   * ARM (cax*) — Hetzner ARM EU has been chronically constrained
#     and is no longer cheaper (per the 2026-05 note in CLAUDE.md);
#     also some Docker images we ship lack arm64 builds.
#   * Dedicated (ccx*) — gated by a separate per-account quota
#     (typically 8-16 cores total), so a class of N students
#     spinning up in parallel hits the cap immediately. Also ~2.5-3x
#     the price of the equivalent shared tier.
#   * Older shared gens (cx42, cpx41) — dropped from the default in
#     this revision; if you need them as extra fallbacks, set
#     ``SERVER_PREFERENCES`` on the repo to a longer list.
