"""config.tfvars parser + Gitea identity derivation.

Reads ``tofu/stack/config.tfvars`` to extract the three operator-supplied
fields (``domain``, ``admin_email``, ``user_email``) and derives the
Gitea identity (admin + user names + display names) used by the rest of
the pipeline. Pure logic + a single file read; no subprocess.

Public surface:

* :class:`TfvarsConfig` — frozen dataclass for the 3 raw fields.
* :class:`GiteaIdentity` — frozen dataclass for the 4 derived fields.
* :func:`parse` — read + regex-extract a config.tfvars file.
* :func:`derive_gitea_identity` — apply the collision-fallback logic.

Why a regex parser instead of a real HCL parser:

config.tfvars in this project always has the same shape — one
``var = "value"`` per line, double-quoted scalars, no heredocs / no
nested objects / no interpolation. A regex parser pinned to the
project's own format is simpler than pulling in `python-hcl2` (which
would add a transitive dependency and a parse-error surface for
syntax we don't actually support).

The regex is deliberately strict: it requires double-quoted values
and rejects multi-line / heredoc / unquoted-int forms. If a future
contributor introduces those forms, ``parse()`` silently does NOT
match the line — the corresponding key returns the dataclass default
(empty string). Downstream pipeline gates (e.g. the
"domain must be non-empty" check in ``run_pipeline``) catch the
empty-after-parse case with a clear error. Tests pin this
soft-skip behavior; if you need fail-fast on malformed forms,
add a post-parse validation in ``run_pipeline`` rather than
tightening the regex (a contributor swap to e.g. heredoc syntax
shouldn't break tfvars consumption everywhere).
