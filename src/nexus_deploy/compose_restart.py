"""Per-service ``docker compose restart`` loop.

Server-side ssh-loop ``cd $REMOTE_STACKS_DIR/$SVC && docker compose
restart`` over a list of service names. Used by two orchestrator
phases:

* ``_phase_compose_restart`` — post-gitea git-restart of services
  that integrate with Gitea (consumes ``state.restart_services``)
* ``_phase_mirror_finalize`` — mirror-mode git-restart loop that
  picks up the latest fork content for jupyter / marimo /
  code-server / meltano / prefect

Kept separate from :mod:`compose_runner`: that module's single
responsibility is the parallel compose-up + docker-ps verification;
a sequential restart loop is a different lifecycle operation.

Exit-code semantics mirror ``compose_runner``:

* RESULT line shape: ``RESULT restarted=N failed=M``
* Empty input → noop, RESULT 0/0 (skip the ssh round-trip entirely)
* Per-service failure adds 1 to ``failed`` but doesn't abort the loop
  (restart failures are non-blocking; the operator sees the warning
  in stderr)
* Transport / parse failure → :class:`RestartResult` with
  ``failed=len(services)``, mirroring compose_runner's defensive
  fall-through pattern.
