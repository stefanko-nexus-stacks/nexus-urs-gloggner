"""Per-stack rsync + disabled-stack cleanup.

Two pieces of the deploy pipeline live here:

* Per-stack rsync loop — for every entry in ``$ENABLED_SERVICES``,
  rsync ``stacks/<svc>/`` → ``nexus:/opt/docker-server/stacks/<svc>/``.
  Missing local stack folders produce a yellow warning and are skipped.
* Disabled-stack cleanup — server-side bash loop that walks
  ``/opt/docker-server/stacks/*/``, ``docker compose down`` + ``rm -rf``
  any folder NOT in ``$ENABLED_SERVICES``. Idempotent on re-run.

Two transports:

1. **Local rsync** (one subprocess per service) via
   :func:`_remote.rsync_to_remote`. Each service rsyncs independently
   so a single failure doesn't abort the rest of the loop — partial
   failures continue with a per-service ``failed`` counter.
2. **Server-side cleanup script** via :func:`_remote.ssh_run_script`
   (stdin) — one ssh round-trip. The list of enabled service names
   is interpolated as a single ``shlex.quote``'d bash string literal
   and matched line-exactly with ``grep -qFx`` (defence in depth: a
   hypothetical service name containing regex metachars couldn't
   false-positive against a similar folder name on the server).

Path safety: every service name passes ``^[A-Za-z0-9._-]+$`` before
being interpolated into either the rsync remote target OR the
server-side bash. A name that fails validation is recorded as
``RsyncResult(status='failed', detail='unsafe name')`` and excluded
from the cleanup script's enabled-set, so the cleanup loop will
(correctly) treat it as disabled and remove any folder that happens
to match — there is no "safe" interpretation of an unsafe name.
Operators see the warning and can fix the upstream
``$ENABLED_SERVICES`` list.
