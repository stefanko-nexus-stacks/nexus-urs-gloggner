"""Parallel ``docker compose up`` runner.

Walks the enabled-services list, expands virtual services to their
parent stacks, starts each stack via ``docker compose up -d --build``
in parallel via bash ``&``/``wait``, and verifies each container made
it into ``docker ps``.

Server-side bash loop, consistent with :mod:`infisical` /
:mod:`secret_sync` / :mod:`seeder`: one SSH round-trip; the rendered
script is testable as a string.

Eight rounds of hardening preserved (one regression test per round in
``tests/unit/test_compose_runner.py``):

R1. ``set -euo pipefail`` first executable line.
R2. Per-stack firewall override applied when
    ``docker-compose.firewall.yml`` exists on the server.
R3. Background-jobs + ``wait`` for parallel deploy; failed PIDs
    surface via the per-service exit code.
R4. ``docker ps`` verification — a container that ``compose up``
    "succeeded" but didn't actually start (e.g. immediate exit due
    to bad config) is counted as failed.
R5. Virtual-service deduplication: a parent stack started for one
    virtual service is NOT started a second time when another
    virtual service from the same parent appears.
R6. Deferred services skipped (woodpecker — depends on Gitea OAuth
    credentials, started by the post-bootstrap pipeline).
R7. ``set -a`` + ``source /opt/docker-server/stacks/.env`` exports
    image-version pins to the compose-up environment.
R8. RESULT line emitted at end with started/failed counts; orchestrator
    parses it instead of grepping stdout for emoji.

    All inputs are shlex-quoted. Service names land in a bash array
    (one per line, quoted) so spaces / special chars in a hypothetical
    future stack name can't break the loop.

    The script:
      1. ``set -euo pipefail``, ``set -a``+source the global env
         (image-version pins).
      2. Pre-deploy hooks (e.g. Dify storage perms) gated on flags.
      3. Spawn ``docker compose up -d --build`` in the background
         for every parent stack AND every leaf stack — PIDs from
         both tiers accumulate in a single ``PIDS`` array, no
         barrier between them. (Acceptable because parents and
         leaves don't share docker-compose YAML or container
         dependencies in practice — the parent/leaf split is just
         a virtual-service-mapping convention, not a startup-order
         constraint.) Each leaf invocation also applies
         ``-f docker-compose.firewall.yml`` when present on disk.
      4. ``wait`` each PID, then verify the container is in
         ``docker ps`` (R4 — fixed-string + line-exact grep). The
         rendered bash splits per-service ✓ to stdout and ✗ to
         stderr, but ``_remote.ssh_run_script(merge_stderr=True)``
         merges them on capture, and ``run_compose_up`` then
         forwards every non-RESULT line to local stderr. Net
         operator UX: both ✓ and ✗ land in the workflow-log
         stderr stream alongside the bash warnings, in source
         order. A future paramiko refactor could preserve the
         split if desired.
