"""Top-level deploy pipeline.

The orchestrator's ``run_pre_bootstrap`` + ``run_all`` cover the
per-stack / per-service phases; this module covers everything that
sits above and around them:

1. R2 credentials load + ``os.environ`` injection
2. ``tofu state list`` pre-flight
3. config.tfvars parse + Gitea identity derivation
4. Read 6 tofu outputs (secrets, image_versions, enabled_services,
   firewall_rules, ssh_service_token, server_ip)
5. SSH known_hosts cleanup (``ssh-keygen -R``)
6. ``setup.configure_ssh`` → ``setup.wait_for_ssh`` →
   ``setup.ensure_jq`` → ``setup.ensure_rclone``. rclone MUST be
   installed before step 7 — otherwise the Round-6 bucket-
   reachability probe sees rc=127 (command not found) and aborts
   the spinup with rc=2. (Historical: pre-Round-6 the same
   missing-rclone case silently fresh-started instead, leading
   to data loss on the next teardown — see ensure_rclone's
   docstring.)
7. ``s3_restore.restore_from_s3(phase="filesystem")`` — rclone-syncs
   the FS bind-mount trees onto local SSD; fresh-start exits 0
8. ``setup.ensure_data_dirs`` — chowns the rsync'd trees to
   container UIDs (1000:1000 for gitea, 70:70 for postgres,
   999:999 for redis); runs BEFORE compose-up
9. Docker Hub login (when creds set)
10. ``setup.setup_wetty_ssh_agent`` (when wetty enabled)
11. ``Orchestrator.run_pre_bootstrap`` — last phase is
    ``_phase_compose_up``, so containers come up reading the
    seeded bind-mounts
12. ``s3_restore.restore_from_s3(phase="postgres")`` — ``docker
    exec pg_restore`` against the now-running gitea-db + dify-db
13. ``Orchestrator.run_all`` — gitea-configure et al. see the
    restored database
14. Display service URLs from ``tofu output service_urls``

Everything runs in-process — no subprocess CLI invocations of
``python -m nexus_deploy <subcommand>``, no ``eval`` of stdout
payloads. State flows through Python objects between steps.

The ``run_pipeline`` function is the public entry; the CLI handler
in ``__main__.py:_run_pipeline`` is a thin wrapper that reads
workflow-secret env vars and calls this.

    """Push current persistent state to R2 before a teardown.

    Counterpart to :func:`run_pipeline` for the *teardown* side:
    reuses the same R2-creds / tofu-state / SSH-setup pre-flight,
    but skips secret reads, orchestrator phases, and service-URL
    banners — none of which apply when we're tearing down. After
    SSH is up, delegates to :func:`s3_restore.snapshot_to_s3`,
    which implements the atomicity contract.

    Exit-code semantics on the CLI side:

    - Hard failure (PipelineError raised) → rc=2, teardown MUST
      abort (operator-fixable: tofu state missing, ssh wait
      timeout, R2 creds broken).
    - ``snapshot_to_s3`` itself raises CalledProcessError on
      remote-script failure (rclone drift, pg_dump error,
      compose-stop error) — propagates out, CLI maps to rc=2.
      Teardown MUST abort: an unverified snapshot followed by
      ``tofu destroy`` would lose data.
    - Snapshot returns ``S3SnapshotSkipped(reason='feature_flag_off')``
      → rc=0, this stack hasn't opted in to S3 persistence;
      caller proceeds with legacy teardown path.
    - Snapshot returns ``S3SnapshotSkipped(reason='no_endpoint_env')``
      → rc=2, flag is on but credentials missing; teardown MUST
      abort to avoid data loss.
    - Snapshot returns ``S3SnapshotSkipped(reason='no_state_to_snapshot')``
      → rc=0, partially-deployed fork (no ``tofu apply`` ever
      ran against ``tofu/stack``, e.g. spin-up aborted at the
      Hetzner capacity step). Nothing on the server to snapshot;
      teardown proceeds and ``tofu destroy`` is also a no-op
      against the empty state. See issue #564.
    - Snapshot returns ``S3SnapshotApplied`` → rc=0, safe to
      proceed with ``tofu destroy``.

    **Feature-flag short-circuit:** when ``NEXUS_S3_PERSISTENCE``
    is not exactly ``"true"`` we return the ``feature_flag_off``
    outcome immediately, before touching R2 creds / tofu state /
    SSH. This keeps the function callable on stacks that haven't
    opted in (e.g. local tests, direct imports outside the CLI):
    a caller that bypasses the ``_s3_snapshot`` CLI's own early
    check would otherwise hit ``PipelineError`` for a missing
    tofu state on a torn-down stack that was never going to
    snapshot in the first place.
