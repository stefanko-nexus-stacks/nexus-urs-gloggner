"""S3-backed persistence for stack data (RFC 0001).

Replaces the per-stack Hetzner Block Storage volume with Cloudflare
R2 as the canonical persistence layer. Server local SSD becomes
ephemeral cache; on spinup we restore from R2, on teardown we
snapshot to R2 *atomically* (verify before destroy).

The module itself is endpoint-agnostic — it talks to anything
S3-compatible via the :class:`S3Endpoint` constructor argument. The
defaults and docs reflect R2 because that's the v1.0 storage
provider per RFC 0001 decision #1; the same module can drive
Hetzner Object Storage or AWS S3 by passing a different endpoint.

This module follows the same pattern as ``setup.py``: pure rendering
functions that return server-side bash. Actual execution happens via
:class:`SSHClient` in the orchestrator pipeline. Two upsides:

1. Tests are subprocess-free — we assert on the rendered string.
2. The SSHClient already handles connection pooling, error
   propagation and structured logging; we don't reinvent that.

Public surface:

* :class:`S3Endpoint` — frozen ``(endpoint, region, access_key,
  secret_key, bucket)`` tuple. The credentials are intentionally
  passed in rather than read from the environment so the rendered
  script never relies on ambient state — and so unit tests can
  inject a fixture without touching real R2 credentials.
* :class:`SnapshotManifest` — Python-level dataclass + JSON
  serialiser for the snapshot metadata. The version-1.0 *rendered*
  bash writes a slim manifest (timestamp, stack, template version)
  and relies on rclone's ETag check for integrity, so v1.0
  ``manifest.json`` files in S3 carry no per-component checksums.
  This dataclass + :func:`manifest_for_components` exist for
  callers that need to compute and emit per-component checksums
  client-side — currently used only by tests and a planned v1.1
  cleanup-and-verify script. See "Open question 1" in
  ``docs/proposals/0001-s3-persistence.md``.
* :func:`render_rclone_config` — produces a ``[cloudflare-r2]``
  rclone profile block from an :class:`S3Endpoint`. Written to
  ``~/.config/rclone/rclone.conf`` on the server. Idempotent — the
  block is identified by name and replaced wholesale on every
  spinup so credential rotation is a single render away.
* :func:`render_snapshot_script` — bash that stops the relevant
  docker compose stacks (graceful drain, not ``pause``), runs
  ``pg_dump`` for each Postgres database we care about, rsyncs
  ``/var/lib/nexus-data/`` to S3, writes the manifest, and exits
  with rc=0 only if every ``rclone check`` passed. Caller is
  responsible for treating rc≠0 as "abort teardown — leave the
  server up".
* :func:`render_restore_script` — bash that reads
  ``snapshots/latest.txt`` (a single-line pointer to the active
  snapshot timestamp; v1.0 does NOT download/parse
  ``manifest.json`` — integrity is checked at snapshot-write
  time via ``rclone check``, not on restore), then rclone-syncs
  the snapshot tree to ``/var/lib/nexus-data/``,
  and runs ``pg_restore`` for each Postgres dump. Idempotent on
  the empty-S3 case (first-time spinup).

Why no client-side rclone bindings: rclone is a Go binary that
ships as a single static executable. Driving it via subprocess
from Python on the orchestrator would mean a) shipping rclone in
the dev environment, b) reasoning about cross-platform binary
selection, c) duplicating the credential handling we already need
to do remote-side. Generating bash that the remote runs keeps the
boundary clean.

Design choices for v1.0 (see RFC 0001 in
``docs/proposals/0001-s3-persistence.md`` for the full reasoning):

* **Cloudflare R2**, not Hetzner Object Storage — the project
  already uses R2 for the Tofu state backend, the
  ``cloudflare/cloudflare`` provider is already wired up, and R2
  has zero egress fees + region-agnostic access. The earlier
  Hetzner-OS proposal would have introduced a parallel storage
  system and a per-region egress cost for non-EU compute.
* **Bucket per stack** — one R2 bucket per ``<class>-<user>``
  slug. Easier blast-radius isolation than ``<bucket>/<stack>/...``
  prefixes.
* **rsync (rclone) for everything in v1.0** — Gitea LFS and Dify
  storage have native S3 backends but that's deferred to v1.1.
  v1.0 keeps the docker-compose layout untouched and drives
  persistence purely via rclone sync of the bind-mount directory.
* **Snapshot-versioning strategy**: timestamped directories under
  ``snapshots/<ISO8601>/`` plus a ``snapshots/latest.txt`` pointer
  file. Retention (30-day NoncurrentVersionExpiration via R2
  lifecycle policy) is enforced by ``scripts/init-s3-bucket.sh``
  in v1.0 — the script enables bucket versioning and applies the
  lifecycle rule via the S3 API at bucket-bootstrap time. v1.1
  may migrate this to a Tofu resource once the
  ``cloudflare/cloudflare`` provider grows a first-class R2
  lifecycle resource. Either way, it stays out of scope for
  this module — the module only writes objects, never configures
  the bucket itself.

    """Render the bash that snapshots the live stack to R2.

    Steps the rendered script performs (in order, ``set -euo
    pipefail`` throughout — first failure aborts):

    1. ``pg_dump -F c | gzip`` for each postgres target into
       ``/tmp/nexus-snapshot/postgres/<db>.dump.gz`` (custom
       binary format, gzipped — works with the matching
       ``gunzip | pg_restore`` on the spinup side). Runs FIRST
       while the postgres containers are still running — pg_dump
       is a client tool that requires a live server. The earlier
       "stop first, dump second" form failed every snapshot
       with "container is not running". pg_dump's MVCC gives a
       consistent snapshot internally; the small window between
       dump and stop may lose writes that happened in that gap
       (acceptable for a teardown use case at low traffic).
       Per-target skip if the container isn't running (``docker
       inspect --format='{{.State.Running}}'``).
    2. ``docker compose stop`` for every file in
       ``stop_compose_files``. Graceful drain with the default
       10s timeout: app processes finish in-flight requests and
       close DB connections cleanly. We deliberately do NOT use
       ``docker compose pause`` — that's a cgroup-freezer SIGSTOP
       and hard-kills in-flight writes mid-transaction. Runs
       AFTER pg_dump so the DB is up at dump time. Per-file skip
       if the compose file isn't on disk (stack not deployed).
    3. ``rclone sync`` each rsync target's ``local_path`` into the
       timestamped R2 directory ``snapshots/<timestamp>/<s3_subpath>``.
       Only the listed targets are walked — db/ and redis/ subdirs
       under /var/lib/nexus-data are NOT included (Postgres state is
       captured separately via pg_dump, Redis is regeneratable).
    4. Upload the postgres dumps under
       ``snapshots/<timestamp>/postgres/<db>.dump.gz``.
    5. Write a slim ``manifest.json`` (stack, timestamp, template
       version — no per-component checksums in v1.0; we rely on
       rclone's ETag/per-object hash check for integrity). Upload
       it to ``snapshots/<timestamp>/manifest.json``.
    6. **Atomicity gate** — run ``rclone check --one-way`` once
       per source: the workdir tree (containing manifest +
       postgres dumps) PLUS each RsyncTarget's local_path against
       its R2 destination. Each check captures two rcs via
       ``PIPESTATUS`` (rclone's own exit, and the drift-grep's
       exit), neither maskable by ``|| true``. Any failure
       accumulates into ``verify_failed=1`` and the script aborts
       BEFORE touching the ``snapshots/latest.txt`` pointer —
       this is the "verified-before-pointing-latest" invariant
       the caller relies on for atomic teardown.
    7. Update ``snapshots/latest.txt`` to contain the new
       timestamp. Pipeline.py interprets script rc=0 as
       "proceed to tofu destroy"; any non-zero rc means
       "abort teardown, leave server up".

    Side note on shlex.quote: every interpolated value is gated
    upstream by the dataclass constructors' charset checks; we
    still ``shlex.quote`` belt-and-suspenders to keep the rendered
    bash safe even if a future caller bypasses validation.

       with empty snapshots.
    2. Reads ``snapshots/latest.txt`` to get the active timestamp.
       If the file is missing (but the bucket itself listed fine
       above), it short-circuits with ``echo 'fresh-start: no
       snapshot in S3, leaving local state empty'`` and exits 0.
       Pipeline.py then proceeds with a clean docker-compose up
       just like a brand-new install. Also validates the timestamp
       matches the safe-path regex before substituting it into any
       rclone command — defends against a malformed/tampered
       ``latest.txt``.
    3. ``rclone sync`` each RsyncTarget's S3 subpath into the
       matching ``local_path`` (which is the absolute path on the
       server — not always under ``local_root``; callers may
       restore to e.g. ``/opt/data``). ``local_root`` is only used
       to ``mkdir -p`` the top-level data directory.
    4. ``rclone sync`` the postgres dumps from
       ``snapshots/<ts>/postgres/`` into a scratch workdir.
    5. For each postgres target: ``DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS
       "<db>" WITH (FORCE);`` → ``CREATE DATABASE "<db>" OWNER
       "<user>";`` → ``gunzip -c <db>.dump.gz | pg_restore -U
       <user> -d <db> --no-owner --no-acl``. SQL identifiers are
       always double-quoted (real role names use hyphens, e.g.
       ``nexus-gitea``, which are invalid as unquoted PG idents).
       The container is assumed to already be running
       (compose-up ran first).

    Order matters: filesystem trees restored before pg_restore so
    any postgres init script reading FS config files sees the FS
    in place. Reversing this would race on first start.

    Does NOT touch ``snapshots/latest.txt`` — the active snapshot
    pointer is owned by the snapshot side. A restore is purely
    read-only against R2.

    The ``phase`` parameter splits the restore for callers that
    can't run both halves in one shot (the spinup pipeline can't —
    ``docker exec pg_restore`` needs the gitea-db / dify-db
    containers running, which only happens after compose-up,
    while the filesystem rsync MUST happen before compose-up so
    the containers come up with the right bind-mount data):

    * ``"filesystem"`` — rsync targets only; skip the postgres
      block. Containers don't need to be running.
    * ``"postgres"`` — pg_restore via docker exec only; skip the
      rsync block. Containers MUST already be running.
    * ``"all"`` (default) — both halves, matches the legacy
      single-shot teardown-side behaviour and keeps the
      tests/snapshot-replay path unchanged.

    Helper for callers that compute checksums client-side (e.g. unit
    tests, a future cleanup-and-verify script). The on-server bash
    in :func:`render_snapshot_script` builds a slimmer manifest
    without per-component checksums in v1.0 — the rclone check on
    upload covers the integrity property cheaply, and computing
    sha256 over multi-GB rsync trees on the server adds material
    minutes to teardown.

    ``created_at`` should be an ISO-8601 string (e.g.
    ``2026-05-11T04:00:00Z``); it lands on the manifest's
    ``created_at`` field. Previously this parameter was named
    ``timestamp`` and silently ignored — misleading API, fixed
    here by renaming + actually using it.

    The version-1.1 plan is to revisit this and either (a) make the
    rendered bash compute and emit per-component sha256 (slower
    teardown, more robust restore) or (b) trust rclone's own
