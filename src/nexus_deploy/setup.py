"""Server bootstrap helpers run before the orchestrator's main loop.

Public surface:

* **``configure_ssh``** — render the ``Host nexus`` block in
  ``~/.ssh/config`` with the Cloudflare Access ProxyCommand. Atomic
  awk-equivalent dedup of any pre-existing block, mode 600 file
  permissions. Aborts (raises :class:`SetupError`) when no Service
  Token is provided — browser-login fallback is impossible in CI
  and we'd rather fail loudly than confuse operators with a hung
  ssh prompt.
* **``wait_for_service_token``** — linear-backoff retry loop
  (5/10/15/20/25s) for Service Token propagation in Cloudflare
  Access. Cloudflare needs ~10s to activate a freshly-rotated
  token; without the initial sleep + retries the first ssh
  attempt nearly always 401s on cold-start deploys.
* **``wait_for_ssh``** — connectivity loop with exponential timeout
  (5s for first 3 attempts, 10s for next 4, 15s thereafter, max 15
  retries). The ramp absorbs slow Hetzner cold-starts without
  converting them into a spurious hard failure.
* **``ensure_jq``** — idempotent ``apt-get install -y jq`` on the
  remote. Bootstrap for VMs that pre-date the cloud-init jq install
  (newer VMs have it baked in via ``tofu/stack/main.tf``); near-no-op
  on healthy VMs.
* **``ensure_rclone``** — idempotent ``apt-get install -y rclone``
  on the remote. MUST run before ``s3_restore.restore_from_s3``;
  without rclone the restore script's bucket-reachability probe
  fails (rc=127 → 2), and the legacy pre-Round-6 code path would
  have silently fresh-started → data loss on next teardown.
  See the function's own docstring for the historical incident.
* **``ensure_data_dirs``** — idempotent ``mkdir -p`` + ``chown`` on
  the Gitea + Dify bind-mount sources under ``/mnt/nexus-data/``.
  Gitea: ``gitea/{repos,lfs}`` (uid 1000) + ``gitea/db`` (uid 70).
  Dify: ``dify/db`` (uid 70 for postgres-alpine) + ``dify/redis``
  (uid 999 for redis-alpine) + ``dify/{storage,weaviate,plugins}``
  (mkdir only — those containers run as root). Called by the
  pipeline AFTER the filesystem half of ``restore_from_s3`` so
  rclone-written files (owned by the SSH user, i.e. root) get
  the ownership the containers expect. RFC 0001 cutover
  replacement for the chown half of the removed
  ``mount_persistent_volume``.
* **``setup_wetty_ssh_agent``** — provision the SSH key + agent
  socket inside the Wetty container so browser-launched shells can
  reach the host without prompting for credentials.

Two transports are used:

1. Local subprocess (``ssh``) for the readiness probes — same
   pattern as :class:`SSHClient.run` but called pre-tunnel, before
   any persistent SSHClient context exists.
2. Server-side bash via :func:`SSHClient.run_script` for ``jq``
   install + data-dir ownership, run from a caller-supplied
   SSHClient provided by the orchestrator.

    :func:`s3_restore.restore_from_s3` in the pipeline:

    Pre-RFC-0001 the rendered restore script did ``if ! rclone lsf

    evaluated as ``!127 == true`` and the script silently exited 0
    with a "fresh-start: no snapshot in S3" message. Operationally:
    every spinup that touched a brand-new VM would *appear* to
    fresh-start (because rclone was missing), and the next teardown
    would happily snapshot the empty local state OVER any real R2
    data — silent data loss.

    Round 6 of PR #555 added a bucket-reachability probe that turns
    this into a loud rc=2, so the loop now FAILS instead of corrupting.
    But the right fix is to ensure rclone is actually installed
    BEFORE the probe runs, which is what this helper does.

    Raises :class:`subprocess.CalledProcessError` on install failure.
    The Ubuntu 24.04 main repo carries rclone 1.60.1, which is old
    enough that ``rclone lsf`` returns rc=0 with empty stdout for a
    missing object (newer rclone versions return non-zero). The
    rendered restore script in ``s3_persistence.render_restore_script``
