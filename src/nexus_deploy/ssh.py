"""SSH client wrapper for nexus_deploy.

Class-based wrapper around the system ``ssh`` binary that adds
**port-forwarding** on top of the ``ssh nexus <cmd>`` and
``rsync … nexus:…`` patterns. The port-forward capability lets REST
client modules (Filestash, Gitea, Kestra) talk to services on the
nexus server via local ``http://localhost:<port>`` calls instead of
rendering a server-side bash curl loop — Python ``requests`` calls
run locally, exceptions surface as exceptions, no token ever crosses
into a rendered bash script.

Implementation choice — subprocess + system ``ssh``, not paramiko:

The user's ``~/.ssh/config`` for the ``nexus`` alias uses
``ProxyCommand cloudflared access ssh --hostname …`` to tunnel through
Cloudflare Access. paramiko's SSHConfig parsing recognises
``ProxyCommand`` but spawning + driving it through paramiko's
``ProxyCommand`` channel is fragile in practice — Cloudflare's
``cloudflared access ssh`` does its own multiplex protocol and we'd be
re-implementing edge cases that the system ``ssh`` binary already
handles. Subprocess + system ``ssh`` reuses the exact path that's been
battle-tested across PRs #506-#515 and adds zero new auth-failure
modes. Port-forwarding via ``ssh -N -L`` works through ProxyCommand
transparently for free.

If we ever need persistent connection-multiplexing, paramiko, or
SFTP-API niceties, the API surface here is small enough to swap the
backend without changing call sites.
