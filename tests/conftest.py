"""Shared pytest fixtures for nexus_deploy tests.

Deliberately kept small — most fixtures (mock Infisical API, mock
SSH server, fake SECRETS_JSON shapes, etc.) live alongside the
modules that need them in per-module test files, since pytest
auto-discovers fixtures from any ``conftest.py`` on the test path.
This file holds only the cross-cutting helpers used by enough
modules that defining them once is worth the indirection.
