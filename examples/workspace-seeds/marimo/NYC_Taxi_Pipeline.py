"""NYC Yellow-Taxi 2025 pipeline — Spark Connect + Marimo.

Mirror of the Kestra `r2-taxi-pipeline.yaml` flow, adapted for Marimo:

    1. Bootstrap: download monthly Yellow-Taxi parquets from NYC TLC's
       public CloudFront and upload each to Hetzner Object Storage.
       DuckDB does the transfer via `s3://...` (its httpfs extension's
       URL scheme — same physical bucket as the s3a:// reads below,
       just a different client-library URI prefix). No compute-cluster
       round-trip needed.
    2. Read all months back as a Spark DataFrame via the Connect server
       using `s3a://...` (Spark's Hadoop-FileSystem URI scheme; uses
       hadoop-aws under the hood, which is configured server-side in
       spark-connect).
    3. Aggregate stats with Spark SQL and render as a paginated table.

Both `s3://` (DuckDB) and `s3a://` (Spark) point at the same physical
object: `<HETZNER_S3_BUCKET>/nexus-tutorials/NYC/yellow_tripdata_2025-MM.parquet`.
The two URI schemes are just two clients' conventions for talking to
S3-compatible storage; the bytes on disk are identical.

Default: 2 months (Jan + Feb 2025). Edit the `months` list to add more.
The Kestra flow has the same default for the same reason — every student
stack runs this on every "Execute", so a small default keeps CloudFront
egress and run time low when a cohort hits the button at once.

Pre-reqs:
    - Marimo + Spark stacks both enabled
    - Infisical has these secrets (synced into Marimo's env on spin-up):
        HETZNER_S3_BUCKET, HETZNER_S3_ENDPOINT,
        HETZNER_S3_ACCESS_KEY, HETZNER_S3_SECRET_KEY
      Without them, the bootstrap cell raises early with a clear hint.

Why DuckDB for the transfer (not Spark): pyspark[connect] doesn't read
HTTP URLs natively, and a "download to /tmp then write via Spark" path
would shuttle 60 MiB per month through the Marimo container. DuckDB's
httpfs streams directly from CloudFront to S3 in-process — same pattern
the Kestra equivalent uses (DuckDB+httpfs for the stats query).
