"""Getting Started with DuckDB in Marimo.

DuckDB is **pre-installed** in the Nexus-Stack Marimo image — no
``pip install`` needed. The base image ``ghcr.io/marimo-team/marimo:0.23.4-sql``
ships ``marimo[sql]`` which bundles:

    duckdb + sqlglot + ibis-framework + polars + pyarrow

So you can ``import duckdb`` directly OR use Marimo's native SQL cells
(``mo.sql(...)``) which are backed by DuckDB by default.

This notebook walks through six DuckDB patterns you'll actually use:

    1. Sanity check — version + simple SELECT
    2. Synthetic data via the ``range()`` table function — no I/O,
       runs anywhere
    3. Read remote parquet directly from HTTP via the ``httpfs`` extension
       (auto-loaded; no manual ``INSTALL httpfs`` or ``LOAD httpfs`` needed)
    4. Aggregate + window function on the public NYC Taxi dataset
    5. Convert query results to Polars / Pandas / PyArrow
    6. Marimo's native SQL cell with ``mo.sql`` (reactive DAG-aware,
       results auto-render as paginated tables)

No schedule, no API key, no Spark. Default queries hit NYC TLC's public
CloudFront — same source the Kestra ``r2-taxi-pipeline`` and Prefect
``nyc-green-taxi-pipeline`` seeds use, but DuckDB streams the parquet
columns it needs over HTTP without ever materializing a local file.

This file was seeded into your Gitea workspace repo from
``nexus-stack/examples/workspace-seeds/marimo/Getting_Started_DuckDB.py``.
Edit it in Gitea or directly in Marimo — your changes persist across
spin-ups (seeding only adds new files, never overwrites).

        # Getting Started with DuckDB on Marimo

        DuckDB ships with this Marimo image — no install step. The
        ``marimo[sql]`` extras bundle DuckDB + Polars + PyArrow, so the
        common analytics stack works out of the box.

        Two ways to use it from a notebook:

        - **Python API**: ``import duckdb; con = duckdb.connect()`` — full
          control over the connection (in-memory by default, persistent
          if you pass a file path), all client libraries available
          (``.df()``, ``.pl()``, ``.arrow()`` for Pandas / Polars /
          PyArrow conversion).
        - **Marimo native SQL cell**: ``mo.sql("SELECT ...")`` — Marimo
          tracks the cell as a reactive node, results render as
          paginated tables, and the SQL itself is a syntax-highlighted
          first-class cell type.

        Run cells in order or hit **Run all** — Marimo figures out the
        dependency graph from the function signatures.

        ## Where to go from here

        - **Persist a DB to disk**: ``duckdb.connect("/app/notebooks/my.db")``
          — the file lives in Marimo's named volume across container
          restarts. Useful for keeping intermediate analytical tables
          between notebook sessions.
        - **Read from Hetzner Object Storage**: the Infisical secret-sync
          writes ``HETZNER_S3_*`` env vars into ``/app/.infisical.env``
          on every spin-up. DuckDB's ``httpfs`` doesn't auto-read
          those — pass them explicitly via DuckDB SET statements
          before issuing the query (the same DuckDB-side pattern
          ``NYC_Taxi_Pipeline.py`` uses for its OWN bootstrap step
          to upload parquets to S3 — that notebook then switches to
          ``s3a://...`` URLs for the Spark read, which uses
          hadoop-aws / Spark-stack settings, NOT DuckDB SETs):

          ```python
          import os
          con.sql(f\"\"\"
              SET s3_endpoint = '{os.environ["HETZNER_S3_ENDPOINT"].removeprefix("https://")}';
              SET s3_access_key_id = '{os.environ["HETZNER_S3_ACCESS_KEY"]}';
              SET s3_secret_access_key = '{os.environ["HETZNER_S3_SECRET_KEY"]}';
              SET s3_url_style = 'path';
          \"\"\")
          # then read with: SELECT * FROM read_parquet('s3://<bucket>/path/file.parquet')
          ```
          (DuckDB DOES auto-pick up ``AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`` /
          ``AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`` from the environment when those
          specific names are set, but Marimo's secret-sync uses the
          ``HETZNER_S3_*`` naming, so the explicit ``SET`` is the
          path that works without renaming env vars.)
        - **JOIN across formats**: DuckDB happily JOINs a parquet on R2
          with a CSV on disk with a Postgres table via the ``postgres``
          extension. Mix-and-match without ETL.
        - **Compare DuckDB vs Spark**: load the same parquet file through
          both engines (this notebook + ``Getting_Started_PySpark.py``)
          and benchmark on your stack — DuckDB tends to win for
          single-node queries up to a few hundred GB; Spark wins when
          you need horizontal scale.
