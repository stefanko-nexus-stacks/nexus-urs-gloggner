        ## 6. Tips & Pitfalls

        - **Stopping a long Spark job:** Marimo's red Stop button does
          NOT interrupt blocking gRPC calls (upstream issue
          [marimo-team/marimo#3494](https://github.com/marimo-team/marimo/issues/3494)).
          To kill a runaway query, open the Spark Master UI at
          `https://spark.<your-domain>` and click `(kill)` next to
          the running app — the gRPC stream will fail back to Marimo
          which then shows MarimoInterrupt cleanly.
        - **Reactivity vs Spark state:** treat `spark` as immutable
          after `get_spark()`. Mutations to `spark.conf` from another
          cell are NOT tracked by Marimo's DAG and can produce
          surprising results.
        - **Driver-memory tuning:** the driver-JVM lives in the
          `spark-connect` container, not here. Bump its memory limit
          in `stacks/spark/docker-compose.yml` if your queries fail
          with OOM, NOT the Marimo container's.
