"""NYC Green-Taxi 2025 → R2 → DuckDB stats — Prefect-3-idiomatic seed.

This flow is the Prefect counterpart to the Kestra `r2-taxi-pipeline.yaml`
seed. Both ship by default with Nexus-Stack, both write into the same
`s3://<bucket>/nexus-tutorials/NYC/` R2 prefix, and both share the same
shape — download monthly NYC TLC parquets, upload to R2, run a DuckDB
stats query, log the result. The deliberate split:

  Kestra  → Yellow Taxi (`yellow_tripdata_2025-*.parquet`)
  Prefect → Green Taxi  (`green_tripdata_2025-*.parquet`)

Same TLC source, same R2 prefix, distinct file family — the two
seeded flows coexist without overwriting each other and let students
compare the two engines side-by-side on different-but-related data.

This file was seeded into your Gitea workspace repo from
`nexus-stack/examples/workspace-seeds/prefect/flows/`
during Initial Setup. Edit it in Gitea — the worker re-clones the
repo on every flow run via the `pull:` step in `prefect.yaml`, so
your changes take effect on the next "Run" without a re-spin.
Subsequent spin-ups will leave your edits untouched (seeding only
adds new files, it never overwrites).

NO `triggers:` block — by Nexus-Stack convention seeded example
flows must NEVER ship with a schedule, so a fresh student stack
doesn't burn through CloudFront's egress budget by firing every
5 minutes on N parallel installs. Run manually from the Prefect
UI's "Run" button.
