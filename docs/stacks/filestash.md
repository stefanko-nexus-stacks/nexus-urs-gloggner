| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Connection Name | Hetzner Storage |
| Bucket | `nexus-<resource-prefix>` (shared bucket) |
| Endpoint | Hetzner Object Storage |

### Usage

1. Access Filestash at `https://filestash.<domain>`
2. Login to admin console at `/admin` with credentials from Infisical (`FILESTASH_ADMIN_PASSWORD`)
3. S3 backend is pre-configured (if Hetzner credentials exist)
4. Start browsing and uploading files

> ✅ **Auto-configured:** Admin password is automatically set via bcrypt hash. S3 backend is pre-configured when Hetzner Object Storage credentials are available. Credentials are available in Infisical.

> **Note:** Only `latest` Docker image tag is available - no semantic versioning published.
