title: Stacks Overview
description: All 60+ services available in Nexus Stack — with Docker image versions, categorized, and linked to upstream reference docs.

Nexus Stack ships with **60+ pre-configured services** that you can enable or disable individually via the Control Plane. Every stack runs in Docker behind a Cloudflare Tunnel — zero open ports, email-OTP authentication via Cloudflare Access.

:::tip
Each **stack name** links to its detailed reference doc in the Nexus-Stack repository: ports, default subdomain, public access policy, architecture diagram, and post-deployment notes. The **image column** shows the exact Docker image and version tag that Nexus Stack pins today — override it via the corresponding `IMAGE_*` environment variable in your deployment if you need a different tag.
:::

## How stacks work in Nexus Stack

A "stack" in Nexus Stack is a self-contained module that combines:

- A **Docker Compose file** describing one or more containers
- An **OpenTofu module** that wires up DNS, the Cloudflare Tunnel ingress rule, the Cloudflare Access policy, and Infisical secrets
- A **Control Plane registration** so you can enable/disable the service from the web UI

When you enable a stack, the Control Plane:

1. Pulls Docker images on the Hetzner server
2. Starts the containers
3. Creates a DNS record (`<stack>.yourdomain.com`)
4. Adds an ingress rule to the Cloudflare Tunnel
5. Creates a Cloudflare Access application gating the route by email OTP
6. Provisions secrets in Infisical and emails you the credentials

Disabling a stack reverses every one of those steps. Nothing is left behind on Cloudflare or Hetzner.

## Image pinning & updates

Every stack Docker Compose file uses an environment variable default pattern:

```yaml
image: ${IMAGE_GRAFANA:-grafana/grafana:latest}
```

The tag shown in each table below is the value Nexus Stack ships with **right now** on `main`. Tags fall into three buckets:

- **Pinned exact version** (e.g. `clickhouse/clickhouse-server:25.8.16.34`, `redpandadata/redpanda:v24.3.1`) — reproducible, deterministic, what you want in production.
- **Pinned major (or major/minor)** (e.g. `gitea/gitea:1.23`, `dpage/pgadmin4:9`) — gets patch updates on next `docker pull`, locked against major version surprises.
- **`:latest`** (e.g. `grafana/grafana:latest`, `n8nio/n8n:latest`) — tracks upstream bleeding edge. Fine for personal use, risky for production.

You override any image via the matching `IMAGE_*` environment variable in your deployment — useful for pinning `:latest` stacks to a specific version, or for testing a pre-release tag.

Some images are maintained by Nexus Stack itself rather than pulled from a public registry. Most use the `nexus-*` prefix (e.g. `nexus-flink:1.20.1`, `nexus-spark:4.1.1-python3.13`, `nexus-dagster:1.12.21`, `nexus-dinky:1.2.5-flink1.20`, `nexus-sling:1.5.13`, `nexus-code-server:latest`). A small number of ARM-native or local-build variants use descriptive names without the prefix — most notably **`soda-core-arm64:3.3.7`**, where Soda's official image is x86-only and Nexus Stack ships an ARM rebuild. All of these Dockerfiles live in the Nexus-Stack repo, layer Python/Java dependencies and ARM optimizations on top of upstream base images, and are built on the Hetzner server during Initial Setup.

## Authentication

Every stack — except those explicitly marked as public — sits behind **Cloudflare Access** with an **email OTP** policy. When you visit a service URL:

1. Cloudflare intercepts the request at the edge
2. You enter your email; Cloudflare sends a one-time code
3. After verification, Cloudflare passes you through the tunnel to the Docker container

There are **no passwords stored on the server** for this layer. Application-level credentials (e.g. the Grafana admin user) are generated on first deploy and stored in **Infisical** — they're also emailed to you on initial setup.

## Public vs. private services

Some stacks make sense to expose without Cloudflare Access (a public wiki, a shared whiteboard, a Git proxy for external CI). To do that, set `public = true` in the stack config. Public services skip Cloudflare Access but **still go through the Cloudflare Tunnel** — your Hetzner server has no open ports either way.

A handful of stacks are marked **"always protected"** in their reference docs — Grafana, Infisical, Portainer, Kestra, Wetty. These can never be made public, even by accident, because they grant infrastructure-level access.

## Internal-only services

Some stacks have no web UI and exist purely to support other services. They are reachable from inside the Docker network only and don't even appear in the Control Plane service list as "open me":

- **PostgreSQL** — used as the storage backend by Wiki.js, Gitea, Metabase, Superset, Dagster, OpenMetadata, Soda, and several others
- **Telegraf** — metrics agent shipping data to Prometheus
- **Soda** / **Meltano** / **Sling** — CLI-only data tools without a web UI

You don't access them directly; you use them through their consumers.

## TCP services & firewall management

Cloudflare Tunnels handle HTTPS perfectly, but a few services need raw TCP access from the outside (Kafka clients, PostgreSQL drivers, MinIO S3 SDK clients). For those, the Control Plane offers a **Firewall Management** page where you can selectively open TCP ports on the Hetzner firewall. DNS A records are created pointing directly to the server IP (`proxied = false`), since Cloudflare doesn't proxy raw TCP. All firewall rules are **automatically reset on every Teardown** — there is no way to leave a port accidentally open.

## Data quality & metadata

| Stack | Image | Description |

## Choosing your stacks

You don't need to enable all 60. A typical setup is between 5 and 15 services. Some sensible starter combinations:

**Minimal data platform** — `postgres` · `metabase` · `grafana` · `portainer`
A relational database, a BI tool to query it, observability for the host, and a Docker UI to poke around. Roughly 2 GB RAM.

**Streaming pipeline** — `redpanda` · `redpanda-console` · `debezium` · `clickhouse` · `grafana`
Source-of-truth in PostgreSQL, change data capture into Redpanda via Debezium, materialized in ClickHouse, dashboards in Grafana. Around 4 GB RAM.

**Self-hosted dev environment** — `gitea` · `code-server` · `woodpecker-ci` · `mailpit` · `portainer`
A full Git + CI + remote-IDE setup with email testing. Around 3 GB RAM.

**LLM playground** — `ollama` · `dify` · `postgres` · `portainer`
Local LLMs via Ollama, a workflow builder for RAG / agents via Dify. Heavy — needs at least a `cax31` server (8 GB RAM) and probably more.

**Data engineer's Swiss Army knife** — `redpanda` · `flink` · `dinky` · `postgres` · `clickhouse` · `grafana` · `kestra` · `jupyter`
Stream + batch processing, two databases, an orchestrator, a notebook, full observability. Around 6 GB RAM.

## Resource considerations

The default Hetzner server is **`cax11` (2 vCPU, 4 GB RAM, ARM64)** which is plenty for ~5–10 lightweight services. For heavier setups, switch to **`cax31` (4 vCPU, 8 GB RAM)** or higher in the Control Plane configuration.

Memory-hungry stacks to watch out for:

- **Apache Flink / Spark** — JVM-based, each TaskManager / Worker reserves 1+ GB
- **OpenMetadata** — requires Elasticsearch, MySQL, and the OpenMetadata server itself
- **Dify** — bundles a vector store, web app, API, plugin daemon, and worker
- **Ollama** — model size dictates RAM (a 7B model needs ~5 GB just for inference)
- **Superset / Metabase** — Java/Python web servers; ~500 MB each at idle

## Adding a new stack

Each stack is a self-contained module under [`stacks/`](https://github.com/stefanko-ch/Nexus-Stack/tree/main/stacks) in the Nexus-Stack repository. To contribute a new service:

1. Create a folder `stacks/<your-service>/`
2. Add a `docker-compose.yml` — use the `${IMAGE_YOURSERVICE:-upstream/image:tag}` pattern so the image can be overridden via env var
3. Add an OpenTofu module (DNS, tunnel ingress, Cloudflare Access policy, Infisical secret)
4. Register it in the Control Plane manifest
5. Add a doc file under `docs/stacks/<your-service>.md` following the template (tagline, settings table, architecture, credentials)
6. Open a PR
